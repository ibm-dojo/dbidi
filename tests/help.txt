<CONFIG> Here should be placed Object, which may have the following properties:
    "handler":       Module, which performs formatting. If not defined, dbidi/stt/common is used.
    "points":        Defines delimiters - characters or substrings, which determine the structure.
                     Value may be written as string or array.
                     Examples:
                         "points": "./;"
                         "points": [".","/",";","/*","*/"]
    "dir":           Main base direction of the structure. Can be one of "ltr", "rtl" and "auto".
    "subDir":        Defines direction of subsegments.
    "bounds":        Defines the boundaries of text segment, within which the search of delimiters will be done.
                     Boundaries are considered as kind of delimiters.
                     Value should be written as array of objects.
                     {bounds[n]}        Object may have the following properties:
                     "start":           Substring, by which text segment is started. 
                     "startAfter":      Substring used as delimiter for the start of the segment.
                                        If defined, property "start" is ignored.
                                        If both "start" and "startAfter" undefined, segment starts 
                                        from the beginning of the whole text.
                     "startPos":        Position, from which text segments is started.
                                        If defined, properties "start" and "startAfter" are ignored.
                     "end":             Substring, by which text segment is ended.
                     "endBefore":       Substring used as delimiter for the end of the segment.
                                        If defined, property "end" is ignored.
                                        If both "end" and "endBefore" are undefined, segments ends 
                                        in the end of the whole text.
                     "length":          The length of the segment. If defined, properties "end" and 
                                        "endBefore" are ignored.
                     "loops":           If set to "false", suitable segment is searched only once.
                                        If "startPos" is defined, "loops" is set to "false".
                                        In opposite case by default it is set to "true".
                     "subDir":          Direction of subsegments, found in the segment in accordance with "bounds".
                                        Can be one of "ltr", "rtl" and "auto".
                     Examples:
                         "bounds": [{"start": "/*", "end": "*/"}]
                         "bounds": [{"startPos": "10", "length": "5"}, {"start": "//"}]
    "subs":          Defines segment of the text by its content.
                     Value should be written as object.
                     {subs}             Object may have the following properties:
                     "content":         Content of the segment.
                     "continued":       If "true", successive segments with the same "content" are concatenated.
                     "loops":           If "false", segment with given content is searched only once.
                     "subDir":          Direction of the segment.
    "cases":         Defines special handling for some parts of the text.
                     Value should be written as array of objects.
                     {cases[n]}         Object may have the following properties:
                     "handler":         Module, which performs formatting. If not defined, dbidi/stt/common is used.
                     "args":            Object, which may have all of above-mentioned properties.
					
    Note the sequence of calls:
        1) Handle bounds
        2) Handle segments with given content
        3) Handle cases
        4) Handle points
